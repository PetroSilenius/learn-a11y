# Website accessibility course

My repo for the course Website Accessibility, v2 by Jon Kuperman on Frontend Masters.
The course can be found [here](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) and the content is briefly described below

> Learn how to make your website applications accessible to a wider audience. Use keyboard shortcuts and navigation to help both power users and those with disabilities. Make sure your website works well with screen readers and explore using ARIA to make even the most complex UI's fully accessible!
